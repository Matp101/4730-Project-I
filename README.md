# 4730-Project-I

4730 Machine Learning Fall 2022 Project I Repository

## Running the Project

There are two CNNs implemented here:

1. `main.py` is hard coded in NumPy. It is less accurate, but works enough that we are happy with it, and is completely done from scratch.
2. phase_1.ipynb, which uses a sequential Keras model. It is more accurate(>98%), but is not completely done from scratch. This is an example of how to use Keras to implement a CNN.

### Installing Requirements

To install the requirements, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes on the dataset

- These images are 28x28 pixels, grayscale, and centered.
