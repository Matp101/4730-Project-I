# 4730-Project-I

4730 Machine Learning Fall 2022 Project I Repository

## Installing Requirements

To install the requirements, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Requirements

- A group of 2 to 3 students (3 or 4 for 4730)
- implement a CNN (not using preexisting network architecture or nulti-layer blocks)
- apply your model to MNIST dataset and compare results with your existing CNN implementation
- Write a shore report (4-6 pages) explainging your implementation and showing results
- You should keep the source from the project

## Notes on the dataset

- Turns out MNIST is not a site of datasets, it is a single dataset of images of handwritten digits.
- These images are 28x28 pixels, grayscale, and centered.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Planning

- Decide on a dataset and how we are going to implement it
- Take the dataset and implement an initial model using preexisting libraries (tensorflow, pytorch, etc.)

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Break up the project into smaller tasks, posting them to the issues tab
- We can have assigned or unassigned tasks
- **Make sure we are all properly using github branches etc**
- The easiest way to start will be to use a library like Keras or PyTorch, and test our implementation in a jupyter notebook
