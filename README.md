# 4730-Project-I

4730 Machine Learning Fall 2022 Project I Repository

## Project Requirements

- A group of 2 to 3 students (3 or 4 for 4730)
- implement a CNN (not using preexisting network architecture or nulti-layer blocks)
- apply your model to MNIST dataset and compare results with your existing CNN implementation
- Write a shore report (4-6 pages) explainging your implementation and showing results
- You should keep the source from the project

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Planning

- Decide on a dataset and how we are going to implement it
- Take the dataset and implement an initial model using preexisting libraries (tensorflow, pytorch, etc.)

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Break up the project into smaller tasks, posting them to the issues tab
- We can have assigned or unassigned tasks
- **Make sure we are all properly using github branches etc**
